# Pick a Bite on watchOS

This is part of **Apple Developer Academy @Binus Cohort 8** challenges which I extend our previous app 
([see here](https://github.com/abimnyud/pick-a-bite)) to help people at the academy find a fun and quick randomly picked food tenant on Green Office Park BSD using their wearable device (watchOS) on-the-go.
With this app, you can just open the app, shake your hand and get the feeling of anticipation for the randomly picked food tenant with the roulette spinning and the **Core Haptics** experience.
